        <h1>Audi A6: Humble Beginnings</h1>
        
        <p>The <em>Audi A6</em> is an executive car made by the German automaker Audi AG, now in its fourth generation. As the successor to the Audi 100, the A6 is manufactured in Neckarsulm, Germany – and is available in sedan and wagon configurations, the latter marketed by Audi as the Avant. Audi's internal numbering treats the A6 as a continuation of the Audi 100 lineage, with the initial A6 designated as a member of the C4-series, followed by the C5, C6, and the C7. The related Audi A7 is essentially a coupé-hatchback version of the C7-series A6, but is marketed under its own separate identity and model designation.</p>

        <p>All generations of the A6 have offered either front-wheel drive or Torsen-based four-wheel drive – marketed by Audi as their quattro system. Second- and third- generation A6 models have shared their platform with the company's Allroad models.</p>

        <p>The modern  <em>Audi A6</em> [1] engine is an alloy of power, low fuel consumption, high technology and excellent dynamics. Both petrol and diesel versions of the Audi A6 are officially supplied. Quite a wide range of engines allows you to choose a power unit with a capacity of 190 to 333 horsepower. These are in-line 4-cylinder 16-valve turbocharged engines and more powerful 3-liter units in a V6 configuration with a mechanical compressor.</p>

        <p>The first  <em>Audi 100</em>, developed by Volkswagen's subsidiary Auto Union at Ingolstadt, was shown to the press as a four-door sedan on 26 November 1968. Its name originally denoting a power output of 100 PS (74 kW), the Audi 100 was the company's largest car since the revival of the Audi brand by Volkswagen in 1965. The C1 platform spawned several variants: the Audi 100 two- and four-door saloons, and the Audi 100 Coupé S, a fastback coupé, which bore a resemblance to the Aston Martin DBS released a year earlier, especially at the rear end, including details such as the louvres behind the rear side windows and the shape of the rear light clusters.</p>

        <p>Audi followed up the introduction of the four-door saloon in November 1968 with a two-door saloon in October 1969 and the 100 Coupé S in autumn 1970. The cars' 1.8 litre four-cylinder engines originally came in base 100 (80 PS or 59 kW or 79 hp), 100 S (90 PS or 66 kW or 89 hp), and 100 LS (100 PS or 74 kW or 99 hp) versions, while the Coupé was driven by a bored-out 1.9 litre developing 115 PS (85 kW; 113 hp). From April 1970 the 100 LS could be ordered with a three-speed automatic transmission sourced from Volkswagen.</p>

        <p>The  <em>Audi 100</em> included a rough engine note that was described as unlikely to discourage buyers whose first car had been a Volkswagen and who aspired to drive a diesel powered (pre-turbo) Mercedes-Benz.[3] The Ingolstadt production line was at full capacity, but supply fell short of demand that during the summer of 1970 an additional production line for Audi 100s was set up in Volkswagen's own Wolfsburg plant, which made it the first water-cooled car to be produced in Germany's (and by some criteria the world's) largest car plant.[4]</p>

        <p>Starting with the 1972 model year, the 80 and 90 PS versions were replaced by a new regular-petrol-variant of the 1.8 litre engine developing 85 PS (84 hp/63 kW); at the same time, the 100 GL was introduced featuring the 1.9 liter engine formerly used only in the Coupé S.</p>

        <p>In March 1971 the 500,000th Audi was produced. By now the Audi 100 had become the most commercially successful model in the company's history.[5] In 1976 the two millionth Audi was built, of which the 100 represented 800,000 cars.[6]</p>

        <p>In September 1973 (for the 1974 model year) the 100 received a minor facelift with a somewhat smaller squared-off grille, with correspondingly more angular front fenders, and with reshuffled taillight lens patterns. The rear torsion bar was replaced by coil springs. For model year 1975 the base 100 was re-christened the 100 L and received a 1.6 litre four-cylinder engine (coming out of the Audi 80). A four-wheel drive prototype of the Audi 100 C1 was built in 1976, long before the appearance of the quattro.[7]</p>

        <p>In South Africa, where the 100 was also assembled, the 100 was available as the L, LS, GL, and S Coupé. Local production began towards the end of 1972; by October 1976 33,000 units had been built in South Africa.[6] The GL received a vinyl roof and "GL" lettering on the C-pillar. The LS was dropped for 1976, but returned for 1977 along with the new GLS saloon. The Coupé was discontinued. The LS and GLS were special versions of the L and GL, with silver paintjobs, automatic transmissions, and special red interiors. L and LS have a 1760 cc engine with 75 kW (102 PS; 101 hp) DIN, while the GL and GLS have the larger 1871 cc engine producing 84 kW (114 PS; 113 hp).[6]</p>

        <p>In the United States the Audi 100 appeared in 1970 in LS guise, with a 115 hp (86 kW) SAE 1.8 liter engine and with either two or four doors.[8] For 1972 the engine was enlarged to 1.9 litres, but the SAE net claimed power was down to 91 hp (68 kW). A base and a GL model were added, as was an automatic transmission.[9] For 1974 the lineup was again restricted to the 100 LS, while the larger safety bumpers were now fitted. Power increased to 95 hp (71 kW) for 1975, by changing to fuel injection.[10] Standard equipment was improved accompanied by an increase in prices.[10] In August 1977 the new Audi 5000 replaced the 100, although another 537 leftover cars were sold in 1978.[11] The Coupé was not available in the United States.</p>
